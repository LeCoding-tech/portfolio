## Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website showcasing all the projects I've done throughout my software engineering career in Road to Hire and the projects I've done on my free time. I built my portfolio website using React and deploying the applicaton onto Netlify. The contact form's submissions uses an API that allows users to submit their information and send it directly towards my database on Netlify.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo onto your local machine. Once you have done this, install the node packages. You can do this by running ```npm i``` on your command line tool.


## Running the app

After you have installed all of the dependencies that are needed for this project, you can open the project up through your command line tool. First be in the root of the directory and then run ```npm run start``` in your command line tool. This will start the React app server, opening the application.


## Stopping the app

To stop running the server and the react app, you can hit ```command + z``` to close both.


## Tests

To run the tests for the application run the command ```npm run test```.
